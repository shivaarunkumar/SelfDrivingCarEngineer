Here's how I did it: I went with a low_threshold of 50 and high_threshold of 150 for Canny edge detection.

For region selection, I defined vertices = np.array([[(0,imshape[0]),(450, 290), (490, 290), (imshape[1],imshape[0])]], dtype=np.int32)

I chose parameters for my Hough space grid to be a rho of 2 pixels and theta of 1 degree (pi/180 radians). I chose a threshold of 15, meaning at least 15 points in image space need to be associated with each line segment. I imposed a min_line_length of 40 pixels, and max_line_gap of 20 pixels.
